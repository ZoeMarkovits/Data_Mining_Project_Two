       <h2>Academic Performance Prediction</h2>
       <h3>Because the strongest features of our model are how many times a
         student raised their hand, visited course resources, viewed
         announcements, participated in discussion groups, and if they were
         absent over seven or under seven times, we can see that the behavioral
         features are the most important.</h3>
